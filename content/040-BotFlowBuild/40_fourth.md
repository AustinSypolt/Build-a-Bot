## Loops

* Loops are useful to allow for some behaviour to be repeated and create a sequence of events that can be reused

* The standard Loops all work as they do in other flows
    * Loop - Start a loop with a counter
    * Loop Until - Loop until a condition occurs
    * Exit Loop - Break out of a normal loop at a certain activity
    * Next Loop - Move to the next interation(loop count) based on a cindition

* They are useful to get a Slot, validate it with a Data Actionand then ask for the value again if it is not correct

* Different from other loops as it captures an answer and loops based on Yes
