## Communicate

* Used to add prompts that are not related to Intents or Slots

* Can be used to provide additional instructions, legal disclaimers, waiting messages or other fixed text

* Uses the Communication Sequence Builder, so allows you to prompt information from variables, such as slot values or the result of a Data Action

* The Communication Sequence Builder can also be used to change the voice of the bot dependant on language and channel

* Click the + next to Alternate sequences and choose a Language and Output Mode

* Several can be added in one Communicate block

* Very useful to make the bot sound right. So, in chat it might be “enter your account number”, but voice “say your account number”
